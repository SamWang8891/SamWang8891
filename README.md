## Hi there 🤖

I am a Computer Science student at NTUST (National Taiwan University of Science and Technology). 

Currently, I am working on improving my programming skills by doing some projects during my spare time.

Ongoing projects:
- **MOD**🛠️ [pika](https://github.com/SamWang8891/pika): Let user able to set expire time for the shortened URL.
- **MOD**🛠️ [cloudflare-ddns-gui](https://github.com/SamWang8891/cloudflare-ddns-webGUI): Make this shitty UI prettier.

Semi-abandomed projects:
- **NEW**✨ batch-get-imdbid: A program that fetches all imdbid of the episodes under a title, helps renaming files for video services like Jellyfin.
